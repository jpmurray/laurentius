This is a life catalogue. Heavily opiniated for the _plantae regnum_, this could still be modified to accomodate other _regnums_, and it might just be in the future!

This was created to manage and display a database of plants that are welcomed and loved in a permacultural setting, for the province of Quebec, but it could contain any kind of plants really.

## Installation

Consider installting those, for image optimization:

```
sudo apt-get install jpegoptim
sudo apt-get install optipng
sudo apt-get install pngquant
sudo npm install -g svgo
sudo apt-get install gifsicle
```

Image optimization will require a queue. Also don't forget to run `artisan storage:link` on first deploy.

Better instructions to follow.
